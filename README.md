#Morio Teaches Finance (Name Pending)

Morio Teaches Finance is a simple web app designed to keep track of a user's spending habits when it comes to video game purchases. In the age of Downloadable Content and Microtransaction, it is easy to not realize how much money you've put into a video game. This app intends to fix that while also providing interesting visual data. 

### Technology Used
* **Ruby On Rails** 
* **PostgreSQL** for the backend database
* **HTML + CSS** for all the front-end engineering. Also used **SCSS** framework to design each page and **Bootstrap**
* **RESTful Routes** designed CRUD routes using the REST convention relevant to user experience.
* **Git + Github** version control used at every stage of project articulating progress throughout the week
* **Visual Design** wire framing & user stories were essential to keep branding consistent. 
* Heroku
